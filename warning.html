	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<ul>
<li>Read and follow all setup and operating instructions provided with the headset.</li>
<li>Review the hardware and software recommendations for use of the 
headset. Risk of discomfort may increase if recommended hardware and 
software are not used.</li>
<li>Your headset and software are not designed for use with any 
unauthorised device, accessory and/or software. Use of an unauthorised 
device, accessory and/or software may result in injury to you or others,
 may cause performance issues or damage to your system and related 
services.</li>
<li>To reduce the risk of discomfort, adjust the viewing focus for each user before use of the headset.</li>
<li>A comfortable virtual reality experience requires an unimpaired 
sense of motion and balance. Do not use the headset when you are: Tired;
 need sleep; under emotional stress or anxiety; or when suffering from 
cold, flu, headaches, migraines, or earaches, as this can increase your 
susceptibility to adverse symptoms.</li>
<li>We recommend seeing a doctor before using the headset if you are 
pregnant, elderly, have pre-existing binocular vision abnormalities or 
other serious medical conditions.</li>

		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Adults should make sure children use the headset in accordance 
with these health and safety warnings including making sure the headset 
is used as described in the Before Using the Headset section and the 
Safe Environment section. Adults should monitor children who are using 
or have used the headset for any of the symptoms described in these 
health and safety warnings (including those described under the 
Discomfort and Repetitive Stress Injury sections), and should limit the 
time children spend using the headset and ensure they take breaks during
 use. Prolonged use should be avoided, as this could negatively impact 
hand-eye coordination, balance, and multi-tasking ability. Adults should
 monitor children closely during and after use of the headset for any 
decrease in these abilities.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Some people (about 1 in 4000) may have severe dizziness, seizures,
 eye or muscle twitching or blackouts triggered by light flashes or 
patterns, and this may occur while they are watching TV, playing video 
games or experiencing virtual reality, even if they have never had a 
seizure or blackout before or have no history of seizures or epilepsy. 
Such seizures are more common in children and young people under the age
 of 20. Anyone who experiences any of these symptoms should discontinue 
use of the headset and see a doctor. Anyone who previously has had a 
seizure, loss of awareness, or other symptom linked to an epileptic 
condition should see a doctor before using the headset.</p>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>To reduce the risk of injury or discomfort you should always 
follow these instructions and observe these precautions while using the 
headset:</p>
<p>Use Only In A Safe Environment: The headset produces an immersive 
virtual reality experience that distracts you from and completely blocks
 your view of your actual surroundings.</p>
<p>Always be aware of your surroundings before beginning use and while 
using the headset. Use caution to avoid injury and remain seated unless 
your content experience requires standing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of the headset may cause loss of balance.</li>
<li>Remember that the objects you see in the virtual environment do not 
exist in the real environment, so don’t sit or stand on them or use them
 for support.</li>
<li>Serious injuries can occur from tripping, running into or striking 
walls, furniture or other objects, so clear an area for safe use before 
using the headset.</li>
<li>Take special care to ensure that you are not near other people, 
objects, stairs, balconies, open doorways, windows, furniture, open 
flames, ceiling fans or light fixtures or other items that you can bump 
into or knock down when using—or immediately after using—the headset.</li>
<li>Remove any tripping hazards from the area before using the headset.</li>
<li>Remember that while using the headset you may be unaware that people may enter your immediate area.</li>
<li>Do not handle sharp or otherwise dangerous objects while using the headset.</li>
<li>Never wear the headset in situations that require attention, such as walking, bicycling, or driving.</li>
<li>Make sure the headset is level and secured comfortably on your head, and that you see a single, clear image.</li>
<li>Make sure any headphone cables if used are not tripping hazards.</li>
<li>Ease into the use of the headset to allow your body to adjust; use 
for only a few minutes at a time at first, and only increase the amount 
of time using the headset gradually as you grow accustomed to virtual 
reality. Looking around when first entering virtual reality can help you
 adjust to any small differences between your real-world movements and 
the resulting virtual reality experience.</li>
<li>Do not use the headset while in a moving vehicle such as a car, bus,
 or train, as this can increase your susceptibility to adverse symptoms.</li>
<li>Take at least a 10 to 15 minute break every 30 minutes, even if you 
don’t think you need it. Each person is different, so take more frequent
 and longer breaks if you feel discomfort. You should decide what works 
best for you.</li>
<li>If using headphones, listening to sound at high volumes can cause 
irreparable damage to your hearing. Background noise, as well as 
continued exposure to high volume levels, can make sounds seem quieter 
than they actually are. Due to the immersive nature of the virtual 
reality experience, do not use the headset with the sound at a high 
volume so that you can maintain awareness of your surroundings and 
reduce the risk of hearing damage.</li>
</ul>

<div class="vc_custom_heading vc_custom_1486467002360"><h3 style="text-align: left;font-family:Roboto;font-weight:300;font-style:normal">Discomfort :</h3></div>
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element ">
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Immediately discontinue using the headset if any of the following 
symptoms are experienced: seizures; loss of awareness; eye strain; eye 
or muscle twitching; involuntary movements; altered, blurred, or double 
vision or othe visual abnormalities; dizziness; disorientation; impaired
 balance; impaired hand-eye coordination; excessive sweating; increased 
salivation; nausea; lightheadedness; discomfort or pain in the head or 
eyes; drowsiness; fatigue; or any symptoms similar to motion sickness.</p>
<p>Just as with the symptoms people can experience after they disembark a
 cruise ship, symptoms of virtual reality exposure can persist and 
become more apparent hours after use. These post-use symptoms can 
include the symptoms above, as well as excessive drowsiness and 
decreased ability to multi-task. These symptoms may put you at an 
increased risk of injury when engaging in normal activities in the real 
world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not drive, operate machinery, or engage in other visually or 
physically demanding activities that have potentially serious 
consequences (i.e., activities in which experiencing any symptoms could 
lead to death, personal injury, or damage to property), or other 
activities that require unimpaired balance and hand-eye coordination 
(such as playing sports or riding a bicycle, etc.) until you have fully 
recovered from any symptoms.</li>
<li>Do not use the headset until all symptoms have completely subsided 
for several hours. Make sure you have properly configured the headset 
before resuming use.</li>
<li>Be mindful of the type of content that you were using prior to the 
onset of any symptoms because you may be more prone to symptoms based 
upon the content being used.</li>
<li>See a doctor if you have serious and/or persistent symptoms.</li>

again. If you continue to have any of the above symptoms or other
